# GitHub Copilot CLI SDK for Rust

A Rust SDK for programmatic access to the GitHub Copilot CLI.

See [github/copilot-sdk](https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk) for the equivalent SDKs in TypeScript, Python, Go, .NET, and Java. The Rust SDK seeks parity with those SDKs; see [Differences From Other SDKs](#differences-from-other-sdks) below for the small set of intentional divergences.

**Releases:** [github.com/github/copilot-sdk/releases](https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk/releases) — combined release notes for all SDK languages.

## Prerequisites

To use the SDK, you'll need:

- Rust 1.94.0 or later

## Quick Start

```rust,no_run
use std::sync::Arc;
use github_copilot_sdk::{Client, ClientOptions, SessionConfig};
use github_copilot_sdk::handler::ApproveAllHandler;

# async fn example() -> Result<(), github_copilot_sdk::Error> {
let client = Client::start(ClientOptions::default()).await?;
let session = client.create_session(
    SessionConfig::default().with_permission_handler(Arc::new(ApproveAllHandler)),
).await?;
let _message_id = session.send("Hello!").await?;
session.disconnect().await?;
client.stop().await.ok();
# Ok(())
# }
```

When targeting MCP tools configured through `mcp_servers`, remember the runtime
tool name is `<server-key>-<tool-name>`. For `available_tools` and
`excluded_tools`, prefer `ToolSet::new().add_mcp("<server-key>-<tool-name>")`
or the raw `mcp:<server-key>-<tool-name>` form. For `custom_agents[].tools`
and `default_agent.excluded_tools`, use `<server-key>-<tool-name>` directly.

## Architecture

```text
Your Application
       ↓
  github_copilot_sdk::Client  (manages CLI process lifecycle)
       ↓
  github_copilot_sdk::Session (per-session event loop + handler dispatch)
       ↓ JSON-RPC over stdio or TCP
  copilot --server --stdio
```

The SDK manages the CLI process lifecycle: spawning, health-checking, and graceful shutdown. Communication uses [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) over stdin/stdout with `Content-Length` framing (the same protocol used by LSP). TCP transport is also supported.

Await `client.stop()` to flush host-owned telemetry: after requesting runtime
shutdown, the SDK closes its owned stdio child's stdin and waits up to 10 seconds
for cleanup and exit before falling back to termination. The shutdown RPC and
final process reap each have a separate 10-second bound. `force_stop()` and
dropping the last client remain immediate termination paths, not telemetry-flush
guarantees. External servers and in-process hosts retain their existing shutdown
behavior.

### Externally supplied streams

`default-features = false` builds an external-stream-only client: no runtime
download, binary discovery, launch implementation, or native runtime embedding.
Construct it with `Client::from_streams(reader, writer, cwd)` and explicitly call
`client.verify_protocol_version().await?` to perform the normal SDK handshake.
`Client::start` returns a configuration error in this build; it never falls back
to an installed or cached runtime.

The default `bundled-cli` feature still enables runtime management. To manage a
runtime without embedding its bundle, use
`default-features = false, features = ["runtime"]`. Existing users of unbundled
`Client::start` should select this feature explicitly.
The `in-process` and `local-runtime` features also enable runtime management;
`local-runtime` continues to use application-supplied artifacts without downloading
them. Enabling `bundled-cli` alongside `local-runtime` retains normal bundling.

## API Reference

### Client

```rust,ignore
// Start a client (spawns CLI process)
let client = Client::start(options).await?;

// Create a new session
let session = client.create_session(config.with_permission_handler(handler)).await?;

// Resume an existing session
let session = client.resume_session(config.with_permission_handler(handler)).await?;

// Low-level RPC
let result = client.call("method.name", Some(params)).await?;
let response = client.send_request("method.name", Some(params)).await?;

// Health check (echoes message back, returns typed PingResponse)
let pong = client.ping("hello").await?;

// Shutdown
client.stop().await?;
```

`ResumeSessionConfig::with_allow_transcript_recovery(false)` rejects a resume that would
discard or reorder transcript records, but permits adding a missing newline after
an intact final record. Recovery defaults to `true` in all modes.
When allowed and performed, `session.transcript_recovery()` returns
the planned backup path, invalid line numbers, and whether `session.start` was moved;
the backup is written on the next append rather than during resume.

After `Client::start` succeeds, inspect its startup cost without parsing logs:

```rust,ignore
let timings = client.startup_timings().expect("started by Client::start");
println!(
    "startup={}ms transport={}ms handshake={}ms",
    timings.total_ms, timings.transport_setup_ms, timings.handshake_ms
);
```

Transport-specific phases are optional. For example, `port_wait_ms` is present
only for TCP and `process_spawn_ms` is absent for external and in-process
transports.

**`ClientOptions`:**

| Field               | Type                        | Description                                                       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `program`           | `CliProgram`                | `Resolve` (default: auto-detect) or `Path(PathBuf)` (explicit)    |
| `prefix_args`       | `Vec<OsString>`             | Args before `--server` (e.g. script path for node)                |
| `working_directory` | `PathBuf`                   | Working directory for CLI process (empty = host process's cwd)    |
| `env`               | `Vec<(OsString, OsString)>` | Environment variables for CLI process                             |
| `env_remove`        | `Vec<OsString>`             | Environment variables to remove                                   |
| `extra_args`        | `Vec<String>`               | Extra CLI flags                                                   |
| `transport`         | `Transport`                 | `Default`, `Stdio`, `InProcess`, `Tcp`, or `External`             |
| `extension_launch_provider` | `Option<Arc<dyn ExtensionLaunchProvider>>` | Connection-global extension launch resolver |
| `installation_confirmation_handler` | `Option<Arc<dyn InstallationConfirmationHandler>>` | Experimental connection-global human installation review |

With the default `CliProgram::Resolve`, managed stdio and TCP transports resolve an explicit `CliProgram::Path(path)`, `COPILOT_CLI_PATH`, then the bundled `copilot-runtime` wrapper and adjacent `runtime.node`. In-process transport loads the native runtime library adjacent to that resolved runtime bundle. There is no PATH scanning.

#### AHP listeners (experimental)

`Client::start_ahp_host` is a thin wrapper over the generated `host.start`
RPC. It is also available with `default-features = false`: the connected
runtime owns and launches the listener, not the SDK.

```rust,no_run
use github_copilot_sdk::{AhpHostOptions, Client};

# async fn example(client: &Client) -> Result<(), github_copilot_sdk::Error> {
let host = client.start_ahp_host(
    AhpHostOptions::default()
        .with_local_server(Default::default())
        .with_on_exit(|exit| {
            println!("host {} exited: {:?}", exit.host_id, exit.reason);
        }),
).await?;
println!("{:?} (in-process host {})", host.url, host.host_id);
// Supply host.token to AHP clients when present; never log it.
host.dispose().await?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

`AhpHostOptions` requires at least one explicit transport: `with_local_server`
accepts generated `rpc::HostLocalServerOptions`, and `with_github_environment`
accepts generated `rpc::HostGitHubEnvironmentOptions` with required `name` and
`compute_id`. Both transports may be enabled. There is no implicit local listener.
Local `hostname`, `port`, `token`, and `require_connection_token` settings belong
inside `HostLocalServerOptions`. Its runtime defaults are loopback, an available
port, and required token authentication. Set its `require_connection_token` to
`Some(false)` to disable connection-token authentication.
The `on_exit` callback remains local-only. All hosting APIs are experimental.

The returned `AhpHost` exposes `host_id` and optional `url`, `pid`, `token`, and
`environment_id`. Mission Control-only hosting has no local URL; `environment_id`
identifies its registration. Environment list/get/delete operations are available
only through the generated `client.rpc().environments()` namespace.
`pid` is `None` for in-process listeners; `Some(pid)` preserves a separate host
process ID returned by a legacy runtime, never the runtime PID. Stop the
in-process listener with `dispose()`. There is no
process-isolation boundary between the host and runtime.
Every explicit asynchronous `dispose()` call forwards `host.dispose`,
including concurrent or repeated calls, and returns the runtime's result.
There is no cached disposal, automatic retry, synthetic successful disposal, or closed
future. Dropping a handle does not dispose it or spawn cleanup work.
The owning `Client` connection controls runtime host lifetime; the handle
does not keep that client alive.

`on_exit` receives an `AhpHostExit`, whose
`reason` is `AhpHostExitReason`. Registration precedes the start RPC so an
early exit is observable. Delivery is at most once; callback panics are
caught and logged. Start failure or cancellation releases registration.
If a cancelled start later succeeds, the SDK sends `host.dispose` after receiving
the start response so the listener is not orphaned.
On owner connection loss (including `force_stop`), already-received runtime
exit notifications are drained first. Each remaining callback receives
`OwnerDisconnected`, no exit code, and an explanation that runtime cleanup
cannot be acknowledged over the disconnected transport. This matches Node's
`onExit`: it does not claim listener cleanup completed or send additional disposal RPCs.
`Exited` reports hosting-task failure, not runtime process death; `exit_code` is `None`.
Do not capture the owning `Client` or its sessions in `on_exit`: the stored
closure would keep its own connection alive through a reference cycle. Send the
exit through a channel to application code instead. The same restriction applies
to session factories and release callbacks.

See [Runtime-host integration tests](scripts/runtime-host-e2e.md) for source
and assembled-candidate validation using the shared replay snapshots.

##### Application-owned AHP sessions

Like Node's `createSession` / `onSessionReleased`, Rust's experimental
`with_create_session` / `with_on_session_released` let the application supply
ordinary SDK sessions without replacing their tools, hooks, or event routing:

```rust,no_run
use std::sync::Arc;
use github_copilot_sdk::{AhpHostOptions, AhpSessionRequest, Client};
use github_copilot_sdk::handler::ApproveAllHandler;

# async fn example(client: &Client) -> Result<(), github_copilot_sdk::Error> {
let host = client.start_ahp_host(
    AhpHostOptions::new()
        .with_local_server(Default::default())
        .with_create_session(|request: AhpSessionRequest, client: Client| async move {
            // Use this request-scoped client instead of capturing the owner.
            // Preserve request.config; add your tools/hooks here.
            let config = request.config
                .with_permission_handler(Arc::new(ApproveAllHandler));
            let session = Arc::new(client.create_session(config).await?);
            // Retain an Arc in your application if it should outlive the handoff.
            Ok(session)
        })
        .with_on_session_released(|original| {
            println!("AHP released session {}", original.id());
            // Any explicit disconnect/destroy is the application's decision.
        }),
).await?;
host.dispose().await?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

The factory may also implement the async `AhpSessionFactory` trait. It receives
an `AhpSessionRequest` containing a typed `SessionConfig` (no permission handler
installed) and a cooperative `cancellation_token`. Preserve the supplied
session ID, workspace, and host-selected configuration; create a **fresh**
session using the provided client and return `Arc<session::Session>`. The SDK
and runtime reject another client's session, a resumed wrapper, or changed
host-selected settings. Application settings not selected by the host remain
free to customize. The example's approve-all handler is for demonstrations,
not an override for managed approval.

For durable application-owned sessions, register `with_resume_session` with an
async closure or an `AhpSessionResumeFactory` implementation. The closure receives
an `AhpSessionResumeRequest` and request-scoped `Client`. Preserve its typed
`ResumeSessionConfig`, restore application tools/hooks/handlers, and return
`Arc::new(client.resume_session(config).await?)`. The request also carries a
cooperative `cancellation_token`.
The callback can instead return a retained original `Arc<Session>` from the
owning client, subject to the same session identity and workspace checks.

Only durable catalog entries marked as application-owned use this resume
factory. Restoration fails if the callback is missing; it does not fall back
to host-owned creation. Published resident sessions attach directly without invoking it or
reconfiguring their current registrations. The SDK retains the exact returned
`Arc` and applies the same cancellation, late completion, and release rules as
fresh handoffs; it never automatically disconnects or destroys the result.

The runtime's handoff deadline is 30 seconds. Cancellation signals the request
token on release, host termination, or owner connection loss. Cancelling the
child token does not stop the host/session. Factories should cooperate with
cancellation, but a late successful return still triggers release with the
**same original `Arc` allocation**, exactly once per handoff. Factory errors
fail the AHP creation; factory and release-callback panics are contained.
Release never automatically invokes `disconnect` or `destroy`. As with any
Rust session, dropping its last `Arc` stops its local event loop, so retain a
clone in application state to continue using it.

The release closure is **synchronous**, like `on_exit`. The SDK invokes these
closures on blocking workers, independently of its lossless internal host
lifecycle queue, so a slow callback cannot block transport routing or lose
another handoff's release. Applications choosing
asynchronous cleanup can move the original `Arc` into their own task:

```rust,no_run
# use github_copilot_sdk::AhpHostOptions;
let options = AhpHostOptions::new().with_on_session_released(|original| {
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        if let Err(error) = original.disconnect().await {
            eprintln!("application session cleanup failed: {error}");
        }
    });
});
```

Host disposal does not await application-spawned cleanup; retain/join the task
in application state if shutdown must wait for it.

Callback registrations are installed before `host.start` and removed on start
failure/cancellation or host/owner termination. Original-session retention is
owned by the application's `Client` handles, not by the shared connection:
session-internal clients cannot form a retention cycle. Dropping the last
owning client handle cancels pending factories and starts bounded host disposal
before releasing their retained originals. Cleanup and release callbacks use the
connection's originating Tokio runtime, even when the owner is dropped from
an ordinary thread. No session `disconnect` or `destroy`
is synthesized. An application-retained session still keeps its ordinary SDK
connection alive and remains usable after the host detaches. Explicitly dispose
hosts before dropping the client when shutdown must await cleanup. The in-process
host remains a distinct participant on the same runtime and session.

#### Extension launch provider

Hosts that own legacy extension process assets can supply a typed, asynchronous
launch resolver:

```rust,ignore
use std::collections::HashMap;

use async_trait::async_trait;
use github_copilot_sdk::extension_launch_provider::{
    ExtensionLaunchProfile, ExtensionLaunchProvider, ExtensionLaunchProviderResolveRequest,
    ExtensionLaunchProviderResolveResult,
};
use github_copilot_sdk::{Client, ClientOptions, Result};

struct AppExtensionLaunchProvider;

#[async_trait]
impl ExtensionLaunchProvider for AppExtensionLaunchProvider {
    async fn resolve(
        &self,
        request: ExtensionLaunchProviderResolveRequest,
    ) -> Result<ExtensionLaunchProviderResolveResult> {
        Ok(ExtensionLaunchProviderResolveResult {
            launch: Some(ExtensionLaunchProfile {
                executable: "/app/copilot".to_string(),
                args: vec!["/app/preloads/extension_bootstrap.mjs".to_string()],
                env: HashMap::from([
                    ("COPILOT_AUTO_UPDATE".to_string(), "false".to_string()),
                    ("EXTENSION_PATH".to_string(), request.module_path),
                ]),
            }),
        })
    }
}

let client = Client::start(
    ClientOptions::new().with_extension_launch_provider(AppExtensionLaunchProvider),
).await?;
```

`Client::start` registers the provider before returning, and reverse requests
are routed at the connection level rather than through a session. The SDK
forwards the returned executable, arguments, and environment unchanged; it
does not discover or bundle an executable or bootstrap. The runtime owns and
overrides `COPILOT_SDK_PATH`, `SESSION_ID`, and
`COPILOT_EXTENSION_PARENT_PID`.

`COPILOT_CLI_DIST_DIR` is only appropriate when the host supplies a complete
CLI distribution containing `index.js` and its matching preloads. When the
executable is a version-matched standalone Copilot binary, omit that variable
and set `COPILOT_AUTO_UPDATE=false` so its embedded distribution remains
selected.

### Session

Created via `Client::create_session` or `Client::resume_session`. Owns an internal event loop that dispatches CLI callbacks to the focused handler traits you install on `SessionConfig`, and broadcasts session events through `subscribe()`.

`SessionConfig::working_directory` sets the session working directory. When unset, the runtime uses its process working directory.

```rust,ignore
use github_copilot_sdk::MessageOptions;

// Simple send — &str / String convert into MessageOptions automatically.
// Returns the assigned message ID for correlation with later events.
let _id = session.send("Fix the bug in auth.rs").await?;

// Send with mode and attachments
let _id = session
    .send(
        MessageOptions::new("What's in this image?")
            .with_mode("autopilot")
            .with_attachments(attachments),
    )
    .await?;

// Message history
let messages = session.get_events().await?;

// Abort the current agent turn
session.abort().await?;

// Model management
session.set_model("claude-sonnet-4.5", None).await?;

// Generated typed RPCs cover lower-level session operations.
let model = session.rpc().model().get_current().await?;
let mode = session.rpc().mode().get().await?;

// Workspace files
let files = session.rpc().workspaces().list_files().await?;
let content = session
    .rpc()
    .workspaces()
    .read_file(github_copilot_sdk::rpc::WorkspacesReadFileRequest {
        path: "plan.md".to_string(),
    })
    .await?;

// Plan management
let plan = session.rpc().plan().read().await?;
session
    .rpc()
    .plan()
    .update(github_copilot_sdk::rpc::PlanUpdateRequest {
        content: "Updated plan content".to_string(),
    })
    .await?;

// Fleet (sub-agents)
session
    .rpc()
    .fleet()
    .start(github_copilot_sdk::rpc::FleetStartRequest {
        prompt: Some("Implement the auth module".to_string()),
    })
    .await?;

// Cleanup (preserves on-disk session state for later resume)
session.disconnect().await?;
```

#### Skill providers (experimental)

Hosts can supply a session-scoped skill catalog and lazy markdown reader with
`SkillProvider`. The provider is runtime-only: the SDK sends only
`hasSkillProvider: true` on `session.create` / `session.resume`, and routes
`skillProvider.list` and `skillProvider.read` callbacks back to the trait.

```rust,no_run
use std::sync::Arc;
use async_trait::async_trait;
use github_copilot_sdk::skill_provider::{SkillProvider, SkillProviderDescriptor};
use github_copilot_sdk::{Client, ClientOptions, Error, SessionConfig};

struct AppSkills;

#[async_trait]
impl SkillProvider for AppSkills {
    async fn list_skills(
        &self,
    ) -> Result<Vec<SkillProviderDescriptor>, Error> {
        Ok(vec![SkillProviderDescriptor {
            name: "review".to_string(),
            description: "Review the current change".to_string(),
            ..Default::default()
        }])
    }

    async fn read_skill(&self, name: &str) -> Result<Option<String>, Error> {
        Ok((name == "review").then(|| "# Review\nInspect the diff carefully.".to_string()))
    }
}

# async fn example() -> Result<(), Error> {
let client = Client::start(ClientOptions::default()).await?;
let session = client
    .create_session(SessionConfig::default().with_skill_provider(Arc::new(AppSkills)))
    .await?;
# session.disconnect().await?;
# client.stop().await.ok();
# Ok(())
# }
```

In `ClientMode::Empty`, built-in skill loading defaults to disabled; set
`enable_skills` to `Some(true)` when the session should use provider-backed
skills in that mode. Providers are not persisted, so re-supply one with
`ResumeSessionConfig::with_skill_provider` on every resume. Cloud sessions do
not support skill providers. Each callback is dispatched on its own spawned
task, so provider implementations must be safe for concurrent calls. When the
runtime cancels a call, for example after its 30-second limit or when the
session disconnects, the SDK drops the provider future; await cancel-safe work
so that dropping it stops the lookup.

#### Typed RPC namespace

High-level helpers are convenience wrappers over a fully-typed
JSON-RPC namespace generated from the GitHub Copilot CLI schema. `Client::rpc()`
and `Session::rpc()` give direct access to every method on the wire,
including ones with no helper today, with strongly-typed request and
response structs.

```rust,ignore
// Common generated RPCs.
let files = session.rpc().workspaces().list_files().await?.files;
let models = client.rpc().models().list().await?.models;

// Methods with no helper — full schema-typed access.
let agents = session.rpc().agent().list().await?.agents;
let tasks = session.rpc().tasks().list().await?.tasks;
let forked = client
    .rpc()
    .sessions()
    .fork(github_copilot_sdk::rpc::SessionsForkRequest {
        session_id: "session-id".into(),
        to_event_id: None,
    })
    .await?;
```

New RPCs land in the namespace immediately as the schema regenerates;
helpers are added on top only when an ergonomic story is worth the
maintenance.

#### Typed MCP installation and removal payloads (breaking change)

Three payloads in the experimental MCP installation and removal workflow are now typed
unions instead of `serde_json::Value`, which brings Rust into line with the other SDKs.
This is the only generated-type change of its kind; every other generated type keeps its
released shape.

| Field | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `InstallationReview`, `InstallationConfirmationRequestReview` | struct with `serde_json::Value` payload | `InstallationReview` discriminated union (`Mcp` / `Skill`, by `resource`) whose MCP variant carries `McpInstallationReview` (`Install` / `Uninstall`, by `action`) and whose Skill variant carries `SkillInstallationReview` |
| `McpInstallPlan.transport_choices` | `Vec<serde_json::Value>` | `Vec<McpPlanTransportChoice>` (`Package` / `Remote`, by `installMethod`) |
| `McpInstallationManagementOutcomeOperation.operation` | `serde_json::Value` | `McpInstallationOperationStatus` (by `phase`) |

Required discriminators reject missing or unknown values rather than selecting another
variant. Optional catalogue trust inside a review stays raw JSON so hosts can apply their
own bounds. These types do not imply that installation or activation is available on the
connected runtime.

#### Installation confirmation (experimental)

All six SDKs (Node.js, Python, Go, .NET, Java and Rust) provide this receiver with the
same semantics: each review gets one cancellation token, concurrent reviews are
independent, and a decision returned after cancellation is never sent. Without a
configured handler, an `installations.confirm` request is refused, which the
runtime treats as no consent.

Set `ClientOptions::with_installation_confirmation_handler` to receive the
runtime's `installations.confirm` callback through
`installation_confirmation::InstallationConfirmationHandler`. The handler receives
the generated `InstallationConfirmationRequest` and an
`InstallationConfirmationContext`, and returns only an explicit
`InstallationDecision`. The SDK echoes the original challenge and review
fingerprint; it never infers approval.

Match `operation_id` and `policy_session_id` against the original action on this
exact connection before presenting the complete review. Missing legacy session
metadata does not select a default session. Refuse unknown operations or
incomplete reviews. Concurrent reviews are independent and do not block the
request router.

`context.cancellation()` is cancelled when the runtime retires the request,
including runtime-enforced expiry, or when the original connection closes. It
retires the pending handler future, so separately spawned UI work must observe
this signal too. Dropping an outbound installation or OAuth future does not
cancel that operation.

Call `client.rpc().mcp().prepare_install(...)` before `apply_install(...)`.
Register its inert runtime-issued `operation_id`, original expiry and captured
session on this client before applying. Removal uses `plan_uninstall(...)` then
`apply_uninstall(...)`; its `operation_id` identifies the operation, while
`plan_handle` is the one-use removal input. Never interchange them. The
`installations()` namespace exposes `list`, `recover`, `status` and `cancel`.
Control uncertain work using its original connection and operation ID, without
selecting a replacement session or replaying apply.

Owned OAuth uses `session.rpc().mcp().oauth().prepare_login(...)` to return
`login_id` before browser, network or cached-reconnect work. Keep that ID with
the original session and `expected_installation_id` for `login(...)` and
`cancel_login(...)`. Preparation freezes reauthentication and display options.
Dropping the login future is not a substitute for `cancel_login(...)`.
Manual MCP OAuth retains its direct `login(...)` path.

These methods require a matching runtime and available owned-lifecycle support.
Capability negotiation does not promise availability; preserve typed refusals
instead of falling back to raw configuration writes. Generated presence and
transport tests do not establish live OAuth, activation or cross-process recovery.

Experimental generated DTOs can gain fields and change raw unions to typed
variants. Existing exhaustive struct literals must add the new fields explicitly
(for example, `expected_installation_id: None` for a manual MCP request), or use
`..Default::default()` where that type supports it. This is a source migration,
not full source compatibility. Absent optional fields retain their wire omission
behaviour; existing handwritten builder calls remain compatible.

#### Generated type-name migration

Resolving a named object through a schema wrapper now uses the canonical schema
name. Where that resolution directly records the earlier containing-property
name, a generated `pub type` alias retains it. Aliases point directly to an emitted
type; conflicting names or targets fail generation rather than selecting one.
Nested helper names are not reconstructed by comparing old and new type graphs.

The affected request/result surfaces are experimental. Earlier nested helpers
did not consistently repeat their owning type's experimental annotation. The
complete naming disposition is:

| Earlier generated name | Canonical name | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `InstallationConfirmationRequestReview` | `InstallationReview` | Direct alias; typed review migration below |

Retaining a name does not restore an incorrect earlier field representation.
In particular, `InstallationReview` is now the required typed review union, not
arbitrary JSON. Existing MCP constructors should use
`InstallationReview::Mcp(...)` with `McpInstallationReview::Install(...)` or
`McpInstallationReview::Uninstall(...)`; verified Skill confirmations use the
new `InstallationReview::Skill(...)` variant with `SkillInstallationReview`.
Correctly nullable fields require handling `Option<T>` even when the old generated
field incorrectly omitted it. The subagent-settings alias retains the same fields
and existing `Option`/JSON-null behaviour, including clearing an override with
`subagents: None`. These are specific migration rules, not blanket source
compatibility.

### Handler Traits

The SDK exposes five focused handler traits, one per CLI callback type. Implement only the traits you need and install each with the matching `SessionConfig` setter. Each trait has a single `async fn handle(...)` method:

| Trait                   | Setter                            | Purpose                                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `PermissionHandler`     | `with_permission_handler(...)`    | Approve/deny tool-use permission requests     |
| `ElicitationHandler`    | `with_elicitation_handler(...)`   | Respond to structured elicitation prompts     |
| `UserInputHandler`      | `with_user_input_handler(...)`    | Answer free-form / choice user-input prompts  |
| `ExitPlanModeHandler`   | `with_exit_plan_mode_handler(...)`| Respond when the agent exits plan mode        |
| `AutoModeSwitchHandler` | `with_auto_mode_switch_handler(...)`| Respond to automatic mode-switch proposals  |

The CLI's `requestPermission` / `requestElicitation` / `requestUserInput` / etc. wire flags are derived automatically from which traits you've installed — clients that don't install a handler are silently skipped, letting another connected client handle the request.

```rust,ignore
use std::sync::Arc;
use async_trait::async_trait;
use github_copilot_sdk::handler::{PermissionHandler, PermissionResult};
use github_copilot_sdk::types::{PermissionRequestData, RequestId, SessionId};

struct MyPermissions;

#[async_trait]
impl PermissionHandler for MyPermissions {
    async fn handle(
        &self,
        _sid: SessionId,
        _rid: RequestId,
        data: PermissionRequestData,
    ) -> PermissionResult {
        if data.managed_approval_required == Some(true) {
            return PermissionResult::no_result();
        }

        if data.extra.get("tool").and_then(|v| v.as_str()) == Some("view") {
            PermissionResult::approve_once()
        } else {
            PermissionResult::reject(None)
        }
    }
}

let config = SessionConfig::default().with_permission_handler(Arc::new(MyPermissions));
```

A single type can implement multiple handler traits — share one `Arc<Self>` across the setters by cloning:

```rust,ignore
let h = Arc::new(MyHandler);
let config = SessionConfig::default()
    .with_permission_handler(h.clone())
    .with_user_input_handler(h);
```

The built-in `ApproveAllHandler` and `DenyAllHandler` implement `PermissionHandler` for the common cases. When `enable_managed_settings` is true, `ApproveAllHandler` logs an error and returns a user-not-available decision; custom handlers can inspect `managed_approval_required` when implementing a human-facing confirmation flow. To observe streamed session events (assistant messages, tool calls, etc.), call `session.subscribe()` — see [Streaming](#streaming) below.

### SessionConfig

```rust,ignore
let config = SessionConfig {
    model: Some("gpt-5".into()),
    system_message: Some(SystemMessageConfig {
        content: Some("Always explain your reasoning.".into()),
        ..Default::default()
    }),
    ..Default::default()
}
.with_elicitation_handler(Arc::new(my_elicitation_handler))
.with_permission_handler(handler);
let session = client.create_session(config).await?;
```

Use `with_ask_user_variant(AskUserVariant::Elicitation)` together with
`with_elicitation_handler(...)` to expose the structured form-based `ask_user`
tool. The default remains `AskUserVariant::Legacy`. Re-supply the option and
handler through `ResumeSessionConfig` on a cold resume.

For rotating per-session GitHub credentials, install a `GitHubTokenProvider`
instead of setting `github_token`:

```rust,ignore
use github_copilot_sdk::{
    GitHubToken, GitHubTokenProviderArgs, GitHubTokenProviderResult, SessionConfig,
};

let provider = Arc::new(|args: GitHubTokenProviderArgs| async move {
    let access_token = acquire_for_host(&args.host).await?;
    Ok(GitHubTokenProviderResult::Token(GitHubToken::new(
        access_token,
        8 * 60 * 60,
    )))
});
let config = SessionConfig::default().with_github_token_provider(provider);
```

The remaining lifetime is required and must be positive when the callback
completes; production GitHub tokens typically last eight hours. Static
`github_token` and a provider are mutually exclusive. The same provider API is
available on `ResumeSessionConfig`.

Initial acquisition runs during session creation or resume. Cancellation,
provider errors, and invalid token responses reject that operation instead of
falling back to ambient authentication. Idle sessions refresh only before their
next credential-consuming operation; there is no background refresh timer.

### Auto routing tiers

Use `CapiSessionOptions::with_auto_tier` to select `AutoTier::Efficiency`,
`AutoTier::Balance`, `AutoTier::Intelligence`, or `AutoTier::Fast`. This option
is meaningful only with model `auto` (Auto mode V2).
It requires a runtime version that supports `capi.autoTier`.
`AutoTier::Fast` is an integrator-only latency preset, not a first-party
GitHub Copilot product preference — the SDK does not decide Fast eligibility
or apply it implicitly.

```rust
use github_copilot_sdk::{AutoTier, CapiSessionOptions, SessionConfig};

let config = SessionConfig::default()
    .with_model("auto")
    .with_capi(CapiSessionOptions::new().with_auto_tier(AutoTier::Balance));
```

The same options work with `ResumeSessionConfig::with_capi` and can be combined
with `with_enable_web_socket_responses(false)`. The SDK omits an unset tier:
the runtime chooses its default on create and preserves the persisted/current
tier on resume. An explicit tier overrides the persisted tier on cold resume. On
resident resume, a different tier requests a safe switch applied after the
resume succeeds; it cannot change a turn that is already in flight. The SDK does not choose a default or manage tier persistence.

### Changing the Auto tier during a session

Change the Auto routing preference without changing the selected model. The runtime does not apply the preference immediately: it records the request and commits it only when a later user turn using the `auto` model successfully obtains a usable model from the provider, so a `pending` status confirms acceptance rather than effect. Only the most recent request survives.

Watch for the outcome through the `session.model_change` event on success or the ephemeral `session.auto_tier_switch_failed` event on failure. A failed activation leaves the incumbent effective tier unchanged. Read the authoritative committed, pending, and activating preferences at any time through the session's `model.getCurrent` RPC method.

```rust,ignore
use github_copilot_sdk::{AutoTier, ModelSwitchAutoTierStatus};

let result = session.set_auto_tier(Some(AutoTier::Intelligence)).await?;
if result.status == ModelSwitchAutoTierStatus::Pending {
    // Accepted, but not yet in effect.
}

// Return to the provider's default Auto routing.
session.set_auto_tier(None).await?;
```

`set_model` accepts the same preference through `SetModelOptions::with_auto_tier`, which stages the tier atomically with selecting `auto`. Use `with_reset_auto_tier` instead to return to provider-default routing.

See [Auto tier persistence](../docs/features/session-persistence.md#auto-tier-persistence)
for the lifecycle rules.

### Session Hooks

Hooks intercept CLI behavior at lifecycle points — tool use, prompt submission, session start/end, and errors. Install a `SessionHooks` impl with [`SessionConfig::with_hooks`] — the SDK auto-enables `hooks` in `SessionConfig` when one is set.

```rust,ignore
use std::sync::Arc;
use github_copilot_sdk::hooks::*;
use async_trait::async_trait;

struct MyHooks;

#[async_trait]
impl SessionHooks for MyHooks {
    async fn on_hook(&self, event: HookEvent) -> HookOutput {
        match event {
            HookEvent::PreToolUse { input, ctx } => {
                if input.tool_name == "dangerous_tool" {
                    HookOutput::PreToolUse(PreToolUseOutput {
                        permission_decision: Some("deny".to_string()),
                        permission_decision_reason: Some("blocked by policy".to_string()),
                        ..Default::default()
                    })
                } else {
                    HookOutput::None // pass through
                }
            }
            HookEvent::SessionStart { input, .. } => {
                HookOutput::SessionStart(SessionStartOutput {
                    additional_context: Some("Extra system context".to_string()),
                    ..Default::default()
                })
            }
            _ => HookOutput::None,
        }
    }
}

let session = client
    .create_session(
        config
            .with_permission_handler(handler)
            .with_hooks(Arc::new(MyHooks)),
    )
    .await?;
```

**Hook events:** `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `UserPromptSubmitted`, `UserPromptTransformed`, `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `ErrorOccurred`, `AgentStop`, `SubagentStart`, and `SubagentStop`. Each carries typed input/output structs. `PostToolUse` only fires on success; override `on_post_tool_use_failure` to observe failed tool calls. `on_subagent_start` can inject `additional_context` into the child agent's initial prompt; `on_subagent_stop` can return a `decision` of `"block"` with a `reason` to continue the child or a `modified_response` to replace its final answer. Return `HookOutput::None` for events you don't handle.

### System Message Transforms

Transforms customize system message sections during session creation. The SDK injects `action: "transform"` entries for each section ID your transform handles.

`last_instructions` includes configured subagent-model guidance when the `task` tool is available. Removing or replacing this section in customize mode also removes that guidance; a `SystemMessageTransform` handling this section receives its complete content, including the guidance, and any replacement it returns is authoritative. Append, prepend, and preserve retain their usual section semantics. These overrides change prompt prose only, not configured subagent models, tool availability, or runtime dispatch policy. `runtime_instructions` is a separate section: removing it does not remove `last_instructions`.

```rust,ignore
use github_copilot_sdk::transforms::*;
use async_trait::async_trait;

struct MyTransform;

#[async_trait]
impl SystemMessageTransform for MyTransform {
    fn section_ids(&self) -> Vec<String> {
        vec!["instructions".to_string()]
    }

    async fn transform_section(
        &self,
        _section_id: &str,
        content: &str,
        _ctx: TransformContext,
    ) -> Option<String> {
        Some(format!("{content}\n\nAlways be concise."))
    }
}

let session = client
    .create_session(
        config
            .with_permission_handler(handler)
            .with_system_message_transform(Arc::new(MyTransform)),
    )
    .await?;
```

### Tool Registration

Define client-side tools as named types implementing `ToolHandler` and attach
them to `Tool` declarations via `Tool::with_handler`, then install via
`SessionConfig::with_tools`. Enable the `derive` feature for `schema_for::<T>()`
— it generates JSON Schema from Rust types via `schemars`.

```rust,ignore
use std::sync::Arc;
use github_copilot_sdk::handler::ApproveAllHandler;
use github_copilot_sdk::tool::{schema_for, JsonSchema, ToolHandler};
use github_copilot_sdk::{Error, SessionConfig, Tool, ToolInvocation, ToolResult};
use serde::Deserialize;
use async_trait::async_trait;

#[derive(Deserialize, JsonSchema)]
struct GetWeatherParams {
    /// City name
    city: String,
    /// Temperature unit
    unit: Option<String>,
}

struct GetWeatherTool;

#[async_trait]
impl ToolHandler for GetWeatherTool {
    async fn call(&self, inv: ToolInvocation) -> Result<ToolResult, Error> {
        let params: GetWeatherParams = serde_json::from_value(inv.arguments)?;
        Ok(ToolResult::Text(format!("Weather in {}: sunny", params.city)))
    }
}

let tool = Tool::new("get_weather")
    .with_description("Get weather for a city")
    .with_parameters(schema_for::<GetWeatherParams>())
    .with_handler(Arc::new(GetWeatherTool));

let config = SessionConfig::default()
    .with_permission_handler(Arc::new(ApproveAllHandler))
    .with_tools(vec![tool]);
let session = client.create_session(config).await?;
```

Tools are named types (not closures) — visible in stack traces and navigable via "go to definition". The SDK registers each tool's handler under its `Tool::name` and surfaces the same `Tool` definitions to the CLI automatically.

Tools without an attached handler (`Tool::with_handler` never called) are declaration-only: the SDK advertises them on the wire but doesn't dispatch invocations to anything. Useful when another connected client services the tool.

For trivial tools that don't need a named type, the `define_tool` helper function (available with the `derive` feature) collapses the definition to a single expression and returns a fully-formed `Tool` with handler attached:

```rust,ignore
use github_copilot_sdk::tool::{define_tool, JsonSchema};
use github_copilot_sdk::ToolResult;
use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(Deserialize, JsonSchema)]
struct GetWeatherParams { city: String }

let tool = define_tool(
    "get_weather",
    "Get weather for a city",
    |_inv, params: GetWeatherParams| async move {
        Ok(ToolResult::Text(format!("Sunny in {}", params.city)))
    },
);

let config = SessionConfig::default()
    .with_permission_handler(Arc::new(ApproveAllHandler))
    .with_tools(vec![tool]);
```

The closure receives the full [`ToolInvocation`](crate::types::ToolInvocation) alongside the deserialized parameters, so handlers that need `inv.session_id` or `inv.tool_call_id` for telemetry, streaming updates, or scoped lookups can use them directly. Use `_inv` when you don't need the metadata.

Reach for the `ToolHandler` trait directly when you need shared state across multiple methods or want a named type that shows up by name in stack traces.

#### Replacing tools during a session

`Session::set_tools` (experimental) replaces the complete set of tools this client supplies to a live session, together with the handlers that serve them. It takes the same `Tool` values as `with_tools`, and an empty collection removes all of this client's tools. Built-in, MCP, plugin, and extension tools, and tools that other connected clients supply, are unaffected.

```rust,ignore
session.set_tools(vec![search_tool, filter_tool]).await?;
```

The agent sees the new tools from its next model request. The new handlers take effect as soon as the runtime accepts the replacement, and calls already running finish on the handlers that started them. If the runtime rejects the replacement, nothing changes. A model request already in flight was made with the previous tools, so the agent can still call a tool you removed; this session won't answer that call, so replace tools while the session is idle if a running turn might still call a tool you remove. See [Changing tools during a session](../docs/features/changing-tools.md) for the behavior shared by all SDKs.

#### String-schema `apply_patch` overrides

With the `derive` feature enabled, an explicit `apply_patch` override can use
`define_tool::<String, _, _>` to declare a root string schema. The model sees a
required `input` property, but the runtime restores the scalar patch text before
dispatch. The typed handler receives a `String`, not an `{"input": ...}` object.
This example returns trimmed patch text; replace the handler body with your own
patch implementation:

```rust,ignore
use github_copilot_sdk::tool::define_tool;
use github_copilot_sdk::ToolResult;

let apply_patch = define_tool::<String, _, _>(
    "apply_patch",
    "Apply a patch",
    |_invocation, patch| async move {
        Ok(ToolResult::Text(patch.trim().to_owned()))
    },
)
.with_overrides_built_in_tool(true);

let config = config.with_tools(vec![apply_patch]);
```

String-schema `apply_patch` overrides cannot contain JSON Schema references;
use an object schema if references are needed.

### Permission Policies

Set a permission policy directly on `SessionConfig` with the chainable builders. They install a synthesized `PermissionHandler` so only permission requests are intercepted; every other event flows through unchanged.

When `enable_managed_settings` is true, the approve-all policy logs an error and returns a user-not-available decision. Custom handlers can inspect `managed_approval_required` for human-facing confirmation logic.

```rust,ignore
let session = client
    .create_session(
        SessionConfig::default()
            .approve_all_permissions(),
        // or .deny_all_permissions()
        // or .approve_permissions_if(|data| {
        //     data.extra.get("tool").and_then(|v| v.as_str()) != Some("shell")
        // })
    )
    .await?;
```

> The policy builders set the permission handler slot directly; they're equivalent to calling `with_permission_handler(...)` with the corresponding built-in (`ApproveAllHandler`, `DenyAllHandler`, or `permission::approve_if(...)`).

The `permission` module also exposes the policy primitives as standalone helpers for the rare case where you want to construct the handler value separately and install it via `with_permission_handler`:

```rust,ignore
use github_copilot_sdk::permission;

let handler = permission::approve_if(|data| {
    data.extra.get("tool").and_then(|v| v.as_str()) != Some("shell")
});
// or permission::approve_all() / permission::deny_all()

let session = client
    .create_session(config.with_permission_handler(handler))
    .await?;
```

### Elicitation

To opt your client into receiving `elicitation.requested` broadcasts, install an `ElicitationHandler` on the session config. The wire flag `requestElicitation` is derived from the presence of the handler; clients without one are silently skipped, allowing other connected clients on the same CLI to handle the request.

```rust,ignore
use async_trait::async_trait;
use github_copilot_sdk::handler::{ElicitationHandler, ElicitationResult};
use github_copilot_sdk::types::{ElicitationRequest, RequestId, SessionId};

struct MyElicitation;

#[async_trait]
impl ElicitationHandler for MyElicitation {
    async fn handle(
        &self,
        _sid: SessionId,
        _rid: RequestId,
        _request: ElicitationRequest,
    ) -> ElicitationResult {
        ElicitationResult::cancel()
    }
}

let config = SessionConfig::default()
    .with_permission_handler(Arc::new(ApproveAllHandler))
    .with_ask_user_variant(AskUserVariant::Elicitation)
    .with_elicitation_handler(Arc::new(MyElicitation));
```

The handler receives a message, optional JSON Schema for form fields, and an optional mode. Known modes include `Form` and `Url`, but the mode may be absent or an unknown future value.

### User Input Requests

Some sessions ask the user free-form questions (or multiple-choice prompts) outside the elicitation flow. Install a `UserInputHandler` and the SDK will forward `userInput.request` callbacks:

```rust,ignore
use async_trait::async_trait;
use github_copilot_sdk::handler::{UserInputHandler, UserInputResponse};
use github_copilot_sdk::types::SessionId;

struct MyUserInput;

#[async_trait]
impl UserInputHandler for MyUserInput {
    async fn handle(
        &self,
        _sid: SessionId,
        question: String,
        _choices: Option<Vec<String>>,
        _allow_freeform: Option<bool>,
    ) -> Option<UserInputResponse> {
        // Render `question` + `choices` to your UI, then:
        Some(UserInputResponse {
            answer: "Yes".to_string(),
            was_freeform: false,
        })
    }
}

let config = SessionConfig::default()
    .with_user_input_handler(Arc::new(MyUserInput));
```

Return `None` to signal "no answer available" (the CLI falls back to its own prompt).

### Slash Commands

Register named commands so users can invoke them as `/name args` from the TUI:

```rust,ignore
use github_copilot_sdk::types::{CommandContext, CommandDefinition, CommandHandler};
use async_trait::async_trait;

struct DeployCommand;

#[async_trait]
impl CommandHandler for DeployCommand {
    async fn on_command(&self, ctx: CommandContext) -> Result<(), github_copilot_sdk::Error> {
        println!("deploy {}", ctx.args);
        Ok(())
    }
}

let mut config = SessionConfig::default();
config.commands = Some(vec![
    CommandDefinition::new("deploy", Arc::new(DeployCommand))
        .with_description("Deploy the application"),
]);
```

Only `name` and `description` are sent over the wire; the handler stays in your process. Returning `Err(_)` surfaces the message back through the TUI.

### Streaming

Set `streaming: true` to receive incremental delta events alongside finalized messages:

```rust,ignore
let mut config = SessionConfig::default();
config.streaming = Some(true);

let mut events = session.subscribe();
while let Ok(event) = events.recv().await {
    match event.event_type.as_str() {
        "assistant.message_delta" | "assistant.reasoning_delta" => {
            if let Some(d) = event.data.get("delta").and_then(|v| v.as_str()) {
                print!("{d}");
            }
        }
        "assistant.message" => println!(),  // final
        _ => {}
    }
}
```

When streaming is off (the default), only the final `assistant.message` and `assistant.reasoning` events fire. Delta events arrive in order; concatenating their `delta` text payloads reproduces the final message.

#### Subscribing before the session starts

`session.subscribe()` can only be called once the session exists. On create, events dispatched before a subscriber is installed are not delivered. Ephemeral events such as `session.idle` are not written to the session log either, so `get_messages` can't recover them afterwards.

On resume with no active prepared subscriber, the SDK instead retains all routed startup events, durable and ephemeral, in an ordered bootstrap queue. The first `session.subscribe()` call claims that queue synchronously, even before the subscription is polled. It receives the complete prefix and any events dispatched while catching up, then atomically switches to bounded live delivery. Later subscribers receive newly dispatched live events immediately, even while the owner is draining.

**The resume bootstrap is unbounded until its owner catches up.** Subscribe and drain promptly: a caller that never subscribes or cannot catch up can retain arbitrarily many events. Dropping the owner discards its unread backlog without transferring it to another subscriber. Stopping the session event loop releases an unclaimed backlog; a claimed backlog can still drain after shutdown without keeping the sender alive. This guarantee covers events routed to the session, not overflow in the bounded client-global notification router.

For create and resume calls with a client-known session ID, the SDK starts its event loop before sending the RPC so it can answer session-scoped requests issued during startup. Cloud creates with a server-assigned ID register the loop after the response identifies the session.

`Client::prepare_session` / `Client::prepare_resume_session` let observers subscribe before protocol activity begins, including multiple startup observers. They return a `PreparedSession` that owns the session's broadcast channel up front:

```rust,ignore
let prepared = client.prepare_session(
    SessionConfig::default().with_event_buffer_capacity(2048),
)?;

// Installed before any wire activity happens.
let mut events = prepared.subscribe();
tokio::spawn(async move {
    while let Ok(event) = events.recv().await {
        println!("{}", event.event_type);
    }
});

let session = prepared.start().await?;
```

`prepare_*` is synchronous and inert — it validates the buffer capacity, allocates a local channel and cancellation token, and touches neither the router nor the transport until `start()` is first polled. `start(self)` consumes the handle and `PreparedSession` is deliberately not `Clone`, so a prepared session can never spawn two event loops. Dropping an unstarted handle leaves no state and closes its subscriptions; dropping the `start()` future cancels the startup, unregisters the session, and lets a same-ID retry succeed. Cleanup removes only the exact registration that startup owned, so a retry started while an abandoned attempt is still unwinding is never evicted by it.

Prepared subscriptions and live delivery use a finite buffer — `session::DEFAULT_EVENT_BUFFER_CAPACITY` (512) unless `event_buffer_capacity` overrides it, and `Some(0)` is rejected as `ErrorKind::InvalidConfig` rather than clamped. Subscribers that fall behind observe `RecvErrorKind::Lagged` with the skipped count instead of applying backpressure, so a prepared consumer that needs a lossless view of a large startup burst must configure enough capacity or drain concurrently with `start()`. An active prepared subscriber disables the implicit resume bootstrap; a resume started without one uses the one-shot bootstrap described above.

For cloud sessions where the server assigns the session ID, notifications can't be routed until the create response arrives; the guarantee is that *routed* events are never dropped for lack of a receiver. Pin `session_id` for full pre-response coverage.

`create_session` / `resume_session` remain wrappers over `prepare_*(...)?.start()`, with unchanged RPC sequences and error kinds.

### Infinite Sessions

Enable the SDK's session-store integration so conversations persist across CLI restarts and grow beyond the model's context window via automatic compaction:

```rust,ignore
use github_copilot_sdk::types::InfiniteSessionConfig;

let mut infinite = InfiniteSessionConfig::default();
infinite.workspace_path = Some("/path/to/workspace".into());

let mut config = SessionConfig::default();
config.infinite_sessions = Some(infinite);
```

The CLI emits `session.compaction_start` / `session.compaction_complete` events around each compaction. The session id remains stable across compactions; resume with `Client::resume_session` to pick up a prior conversation. Workspace state lives under `~/.copilot/session-state/{sessionId}` by default — override with `workspace_path` to relocate.

`enable_session_store` on `SessionConfig` enables the cross-session store for search and retrieval across sessions. When unset in the default client mode, the runtime default applies (enabled). In `Empty` mode, defaults to disabled.

### Memory

Configure the runtime memory feature for a session:
For more background, see [About GitHub Copilot Memory](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/copilot-memory).

```rust,ignore
use github_copilot_sdk::types::{MemoryConfiguration, SessionConfig};

let config = SessionConfig::default().with_memory(MemoryConfiguration::enabled());
```

`MemoryConfiguration` is accepted on both `Client::create_session` and `Client::resume_session` (via `ResumeSessionConfig::with_memory`). `enabled` toggles the feature.

The client mode affects the default: in the default `ClientMode::CopilotCli` the SDK leaves `memory` unset so the runtime applies its own default, while `ClientMode::Empty` defaults `memory` to disabled unless you set it explicitly.

### Custom Providers (BYOK)

Route model traffic through your own inference endpoint instead of GitHub's hosted models:

```rust,ignore
use github_copilot_sdk::types::ProviderConfig;

let mut provider = ProviderConfig::default();
provider.provider_type = Some("openai".to_string());
provider.base_url = "https://my-proxy.example.com/v1".to_string();
provider.bearer_token = Some(std::env::var("OPENAI_API_KEY")?);

let mut config = SessionConfig::default();
config.provider = Some(provider);
```

Provider types include `"openai"`, `"azure"`, and `"anthropic"`. Set `wire_api` to `"completions"` or `"responses"` (OpenAI/Azure only). Custom headers go in `provider.headers`. The SDK forwards the configuration to the CLI verbatim — the CLI handles the upstream call, including authentication.

### Telemetry

Forward OpenTelemetry signals from the spawned CLI process to your collector:

```rust,ignore
use github_copilot_sdk::{ClientOptions, OtelExporterType, OtlpHttpProtocol, TelemetryConfig};

let mut telem = TelemetryConfig::default();
telem.exporter_type = Some(OtelExporterType::OtlpHttp);
telem.otlp_endpoint = Some("http://localhost:4318".to_string());
telem.otlp_protocol = Some(OtlpHttpProtocol::HttpProtobuf);
telem.source_name = Some("my-app".to_string());

let mut opts = ClientOptions::default();
opts.telemetry = Some(telem);
let client = Client::start(opts).await?;
```

The SDK injects the appropriate environment variables (`COPILOT_OTEL_EXPORTER_TYPE`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL`, ...) into the spawned CLI process. The SDK takes no OpenTelemetry dependency; the CLI itself owns the exporter pipeline. Caller-supplied `ClientOptions::env` entries override telemetry-injected values.

### Message Source

Use `MessageSource::System` for automated messages sent by your application. Ordinary human sends leave `source` unset, so the field is omitted from the request. Use `MessageSource::User` when you need to set it explicitly.

For messages from another agent, use `MessageSource::Agent("sender-id".into())` with the trusted sender ID. It serializes as `"agent-sender-id"` and works with both `MessageOptions::with_source` and `rpc::SendRequest::with_source`. Unlike internal system context, an identified agent message retains agent provenance.

```rust,no_run
use github_copilot_sdk::{MessageOptions, MessageSource, session::Session};

# async fn example(session: &Session) -> Result<(), github_copilot_sdk::Error> {
session
    .send(MessageOptions::new("Context updated").with_source(MessageSource::System))
    .await?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

The raw RPC path supports the same builder, including requests with JSON attachments:

```rust,no_run
use github_copilot_sdk::{MessageSource, rpc::SendRequest, session::Session};

# async fn example(session: &Session) -> Result<(), github_copilot_sdk::Error> {
let mut request = SendRequest::default().with_source(MessageSource::System);
request.prompt = "Context updated".into();
request.attachments = Some(vec![serde_json::json!({
    "type": "github_url",
    "url": "https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk"
})]);
session.rpc().send(request).await?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

Both paths use ordinary `session.send`. Source does not select a delivery mode or set billing flags; the runtime applies its existing source behavior. `send_and_wait` still completes on `session.idle` and may return `Ok(None)` when no assistant message was emitted. Genuine errors still propagate.

### Progress Reporting (`send_and_wait`)

For fire-and-forget messaging where you need to block until the agent finishes:

```rust,ignore
use std::time::Duration;
use github_copilot_sdk::MessageOptions;

// Sends a message and blocks until the root session.idle or session.error
session
    .send_and_wait(
        MessageOptions::new("Fix the bug").with_wait_timeout(Duration::from_secs(120)),
    )
    .await?;
```

Default timeout is 60 seconds. Only one unformatted `send_and_wait` can be active
per session; it also prevents other sends until it completes. Events attributed
to a sub-agent (with a non-empty `agentId`) are still delivered to subscribers,
but cannot supply the reply or end the parent's wait.
The terminal event is queued to existing subscriptions before the wait returns;
subscribers consume their streams independently and do not delay completion.

### Structured output (experimental)

Enable the existing `derive` feature and use the same `schemars`/Serde integration
as typed custom tools:

```rust,no_run
# #[cfg(feature = "derive")]
# mod example {
use schemars::JsonSchema;
use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(Deserialize, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]
struct Inventory {
    count: i32,
    color: String,
}

# async fn example(session: &github_copilot_sdk::session::Session) -> Result<(), github_copilot_sdk::Error> {
let inventory: Inventory = session
    .send_and_wait_typed("Call get_inventory, then report the widget count and color.")
    .await?;
# Ok(())
# }
# }
```

The helper uses the existing `schema_for::<T>()` generator and deserializes the
final JSON. Serde deserialization is not full JSON Schema validation. Provider
schema restrictions apply; `deny_unknown_fields` closes objects for strict output.
For explicit schemas, `MessageOptions::with_response_schema` works with `send` or
`send_and_wait` without the `derive` feature and returns ordinary events.

Schemas apply to one run, including tools, steering, and stop-hook corrections,
not independent sends or subagents. Streaming remains text. Structured waits
select the last correlated root message without tool requests at non-autopilot
idle and support concurrent structured waits with independent results. Later
queued work can delay idle. Aborts, session errors after the run starts, missing
output, and event-stream lag fail the wait. Dropping the future or timing out
unsubscribes without aborting the agent. Immediate steering cannot set a schema.

### Newtypes

**`SessionId`** — a newtype wrapper around `String` that prevents accidentally passing workspace IDs or request IDs where session IDs are expected. Transparent serialization (`#[serde(transparent)]`), zero-cost `Deref<Target=str>`, and ergonomic comparisons with `&str` and `String`.

```rust,ignore
use github_copilot_sdk::SessionId;

let id = SessionId::new("sess-abc123");
assert_eq!(id, "sess-abc123");           // compare with &str
let raw: String = id.into_inner();       // unwrap when needed
```

### Error Handling

The SDK uses a typed error enum:

```rust,ignore
pub enum Error {
    Protocol(ProtocolError),       // JSON-RPC framing, CLI startup, version mismatch
    Rpc { code: i32, message: String }, // CLI returned an error response
    Session(SessionError),         // Session not found, agent error, timeout, conflicts
    Io(std::io::Error),            // Transport I/O error
    Json(serde_json::Error),       // Serialization error
    BinaryNotFound { name, hint }, // CLI binary not found
}

// Check if the transport is broken (caller should discard the client)
if err.is_transport_failure() {
    client = Client::start(options).await?;
}
```

## Differences From Other SDKs

The Rust SDK aligns closely with the Node, Python, Go, and .NET SDKs but diverges
in a few places where Rust idiom or the type system gives a clearly better
shape, and exposes a small additional surface where the language affords
ergonomics the dynamically-typed SDKs don't.

### Shape divergence

- **`SessionFsProvider` registration is direct, not factory-closure.** Where
  Node/Python/Go/.NET accept a closure that the runtime calls on each
  session-create to build a fresh provider, the Rust SDK takes
  `Arc<dyn SessionFsProvider>` directly via
  [`SessionConfig::with_session_fs_provider`]. The factory pattern doesn't
  cleanly express in Rust at the session-config call site — there is no
  `Session` value to thread in, and the SDK already prefers traits over
  boxed closures for handler-shaped APIs (`PermissionHandler`, `ToolHandler`,
  `SessionHooks`,
  `SystemMessageTransform`).

```rust,ignore
use std::sync::Arc;
use github_copilot_sdk::session_fs::{SessionFsConfig, SessionFsConventions};

let mut options = ClientOptions::default();
options.session_fs = Some(SessionFsConfig::new(
    "/workspace",
    "/workspace/.copilot",
    SessionFsConventions::Posix,
));
let client = Client::start(options).await?;

let session = client
    .create_session(
        SessionConfig::default()
            .with_permission_handler(Arc::new(ApproveAllHandler))
            .with_session_fs_provider(Arc::new(MyProvider::new())),
    )
    .await?;
```

See [`examples/session_fs.rs`](examples/session_fs.rs) for a complete
in-memory provider implementation.
To let the `view` tool read images stored only in that provider, enable
`SessionFsCapabilities::new().with_binary(true)` with
`SessionFsConfig::with_capabilities`, implement `SessionFsBinaryProvider`
(`read_file_bytes` and `write_file_bytes`), and return it from
`SessionFsProvider::binary`. A registered provider
without binary support does not fall back to a local file with the same
path.

Binary reads and writes are limited to 50,330,880 raw bytes (approximately 48 MiB);
larger results return a filesystem error before encoding or decoding.

- **Canvas action dispatch is a single trait method, not per-action closures.**
  The Node SDK binds an optional `handler` closure on each entry of a canvas's
  `actions[]`. The Rust SDK exposes
  [`CanvasHandler::on_action`](crate::canvas::CanvasHandler::on_action) and expects the implementor to match on
  `ctx.action_name`. Same reasoning as `SessionFsProvider`: per-callback
  `Box<dyn Fn>` fields fight `Send + Sync + 'static` and skip exhaustiveness
  checks, and the SDK prefers trait + default-impl methods for handler-shaped
  extension points.

### Rust-only API

A handful of conveniences exist only on the Rust SDK as of 0.1.0. These
are surface areas where Rust idiom (newtypes, enums, trait objects)
gives a clearly nicer shape than Node/Python/Go/.NET currently expose. Rust
gets to be Rust here — cross-SDK parity for these is a post-release
conversation, not a release blocker. None of these are deprecated and
none of them are scheduled for removal.

- **Typed newtypes** — `SessionId` and `RequestId` are `#[serde(transparent)]`
  newtypes around `String`, so the type system distinguishes a session
  identifier from an arbitrary `String` at compile time. Node/Python/Go
  use bare strings.
- **Permission policy builders** — `permission::approve_all`,
  `permission::deny_all`, and `permission::approve_if(predicate)`
  in `crate::permission` provide composable, no-handler-needed
  `PermissionHandler` shortcuts. Other SDKs require a
  full handler implementation for these patterns.
- **`Client::from_streams`** — connect to a CLI server over arbitrary
  caller-supplied `AsyncRead` / `AsyncWrite`. Useful for testing,
  in-process embedding, or custom transports. Other SDKs are spawn-only
  or fixed-stdio.
- **`enum Transport { Default, Stdio, InProcess, Tcp, External }`** — explicit
  transport selector on `ClientOptions::transport`. Node/Python/Go rely
  on conditional config field combinations instead.
- **Split `prefix_args` / `extra_args`** on `ClientOptions` — separate
  arg vectors for "prepend before subcommand" vs "append after the
  built-in flags", giving precise control over CLI invocation order
  without string-splicing.
- **`Client::prepare_session` / `prepare_resume_session`** — return an inert
  `PreparedSession` whose `subscribe()` installs an event receiver before any
  protocol activity, including multiple startup observers, subject to bounded
  delivery. Without a prepared observer, resume retains routed events for the
  first `Session::subscribe()` owner until it catches up; create remains
  live-only. Other SDKs install event callbacks before session startup.

## Bundled runtime artifacts

The SDK provisions two verified artifacts at build time. By default the
`bundled-cli` feature embeds both the full Copilot CLI/Node SEA and a separate
runtime bundle containing `copilot-runtime`, adjacent `runtime.node`, and its
required assets. Managed transports use only the runtime bundle; the full CLI
is available through `install_bundled_cli` for diagnostics and version probes.
Enable `bundled-in-process` to additionally include the native runtime library
in the runtime bundle and use `Transport::InProcess`:

```toml
github-copilot-sdk = { version = "1", features = ["bundled-in-process"] }
```

`CliProgram::Path` and raw `ClientOptions::extra_args` apply only to
child-process transports. Set `COPILOT_CLI_PATH` only when using an externally
provisioned compatible runtime package with in-process transport.

Applications that already ship a compatible runtime can enable `local-runtime`
instead. This enables `Transport::InProcess` without downloading, extracting,
or embedding SDK-managed runtime artifacts:

```toml
github-copilot-sdk = { version = "1", default-features = false, features = ["local-runtime"] }
```

The default `bundled-cli` feature takes precedence when both features are
enabled, preserving bundled behavior for `--all-features` builds.

`COPILOT_CLI_PATH` must point to the application's CLI entrypoint, with the
compatible native runtime library next to it.

For managed transports without embedded artifacts, disable `bundled-cli` while
enabling `runtime`:

```toml
github-copilot-sdk = { version = "1", default-features = false, features = ["runtime"] }
```

> **You become responsible for supplying the runtime at deployment.** With
> `runtime` enabled and `bundled-cli` disabled, the produced binary does not contain these artifacts
> and will not search the system for them. For managed child-process transports,
> supply a compatible wrapper pair via an explicit [`CliProgram::Path`].

> **Convenience on the build machine only.** As a special case,

> builds (release artifacts, signed installers, container images, etc.)

> `CliProgram::Path`.

With no features enabled (`default-features = false` alone), the SDK is
external-stream-only: `build.rs` does not acquire runtime artifacts. Use
`Client::from_streams`; `Client::start` returns `InvalidConfig` even if an
explicit program path is supplied.

### How it works

1. **Version pin.** `build.rs` reads the CLI version from one of two sources:
   - `cli-version.txt` and `cli-version-in-process.txt` at the crate root
     (present in published crate tarballs and vendored slots).
   - Otherwise, `../nodejs/package.json` (contributor build inside the github/copilot-sdk repo).

   When SDK-managed acquisition is enabled, the resolved version is baked into the crate via `cargo:rustc-env=COPILOT_SDK_CLI_VERSION`. A release-scoped `COPILOT_SDK_CLI_CACHE_ID` lets the runtime resolver recompute the on-disk path without leaking absolute build-machine paths into the rlib.

   Stable/prerelease snapshots, including existing published crates, acquire
   assets from `github/copilot-cli` at `v<runtime-version>`. Public unstable
   snapshots additionally pin
   `release-url=https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk/releases/download/runtime-<runtime-version>`.
   Both snapshots must agree on the version and release URL. Executables,
   runtime packages, and checksum lookups all use that exact public release;
   consumers need no credentials or unstable-specific environment settings.

   Source checkouts without snapshots infer the SDK-hosted release for canonical
   unstable pins in `nodejs/package.json`, including both
   `X.Y.Z-unstable.r<run-id>.g<sha>` and `X.Y.Z-N.unstable.r<run-id>.g<sha>`.
   Other source pins and legacy snapshots without `release-url` continue to use
   the CLI release location.

2. **Build time:** `build.rs` downloads the platform-specific full CLI archive
   and runtime package, then verifies both SHA-256 hashes against the release's
   `SHA256SUMS.txt` or the publish snapshots.
   Then:
   - **`bundled-cli` on (default):** embeds the full CLI release archive and a
     separately filtered runtime archive containing `copilot-runtime[.exe]`,
     `runtime.node`, and required assets.
   - **`in-process` on:** the runtime archive additionally contains the
     platform-native runtime library (`.dll`, `.so`, or `.dylib`).
   - **`local-runtime` on and `bundled-cli` off:** skips this acquisition step
     entirely because the application supplies the runtime package.
   - **`runtime` off:** skips acquisition entirely; only externally supplied
     streams are supported.
   - **`runtime` on, `bundled-cli` and `local-runtime` off:** downloads only the runtime package and extracts its
     managed runtime artifacts directly into the platform cache using staging
     files and atomic renames.

3. **Runtime:** embedded CLI artifacts and build-time-extracted hostless runtime
   artifacts use separate versioned namespaces:

   | OS | `bundled-cli` on | `runtime` on, `bundled-cli` and `local-runtime` off |
   |----|------------------|-------------------|
   | macOS | `~/Library/Caches/github-copilot-sdk/cli/<version>/` | `~/Library/Caches/github-copilot-sdk/runtime/<version>/` |
   | Linux | `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/github-copilot-sdk/cli/<version>/` | `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/github-copilot-sdk/runtime/<version>/` |
   | Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\github-copilot-sdk\cli\<version>\` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\github-copilot-sdk\runtime\<version>\` |

   Separating these namespaces prevents stale hostless-runtime cleanup during a
   non-bundled build from deleting a same-version bundled CLI used by another
   application. Old version directories accumulate in siblings; clean them up
   at your leisure.

   Public unstable cache directories use
   `copilot-sdk-runtime-<version>` instead of `<version>` to keep release
   destinations separate. Legacy cache paths remain unchanged.

### Overriding the extraction location

[`ClientOptions::with_bundled_cli_extract_dir`] redirects embed-mode extraction to a custom directory (CI runners with ephemeral homes, sandboxes that disallow cache paths, etc.):

```rust,ignore
use std::path::PathBuf;
use github_copilot_sdk::{Client, ClientOptions};

let options = ClientOptions::new()
    .with_bundled_cli_extract_dir(PathBuf::from("/var/run/my-app/copilot"));
let client = Client::start(options).await?;
```

With `runtime` enabled and both `bundled-cli` and `local-runtime` disabled, the equivalent knob is the **`COPILOT_CLI_EXTRACT_DIR`** environment variable, which is honored symmetrically at build time (where `build.rs` writes the binary) and at runtime (where the resolver reads it). When set, the binary lives directly under the named directory (no per-version subdir). The most ergonomic way to pin it from a consumer crate is `.cargo/config.toml`:

```toml
# .cargo/config.toml at the consumer's repo root
[env]
COPILOT_CLI_EXTRACT_DIR = { value = "vendor/copilot", relative = true, force = true }
```

`relative = true` resolves the path against the config file's directory, so the value is stable regardless of where `cargo build` is invoked from. `force = true` makes the value visible to invocations of the produced binary under `cargo run` / `cargo test`, keeping build and runtime in sync. For runtime invocations outside cargo (e.g. a deploy script running the binary directly), either export the same env var or use [`CliProgram::Path`] / `COPILOT_CLI_PATH` at runtime.

### Skipping the bundle entirely

Enable `local-runtime` to disable the entire download / bundle / cache
mechanism for applications that host a locally supplied runtime in process.
`build.rs` returns immediately without touching the network, and runtime
resolution requires `COPILOT_CLI_PATH` to identify the supplied package.

`COPILOT_SKIP_CLI_DOWNLOAD=1` remains available as an explicit build-time
override for managed child-process consumers. It works regardless of the
`bundled-cli` feature state; runtime resolution falls through to
`Error::BinaryNotFound` unless an applicable explicit source resolves.

### Resolution priority

For managed child-process transports (`runtime` enabled), `Client::start` resolves the program in this order:

1. Explicit `CliProgram::Path(path)` on `ClientOptions::program`.
2. `COPILOT_CLI_PATH` environment variable, if it points at a real file.
3. **`bundled-cli` on:** the embedded wrapper pair, lazily extracted on first call.
4. **`bundled-cli` and `local-runtime` off:** the build-time-extracted wrapper pair in the per-user cache.

In-process transport loads the native runtime library adjacent to the runtime
wrapper selected from `COPILOT_CLI_PATH`, the embedded runtime archive, or the
build-time cache. There is no PATH scanning.

### Reaching the bundled binary without a `Client`

Health checks, diagnostics, and version probes often need the bundled
CLI's path *before* any session starts — and for callers that always
override `program` with `CliProgram::Path(...)`, `Client::start`'s
resolver may never run. Use [`install_bundled_cli`] for those cases:

```rust,no_run
use github_copilot_sdk::{HAS_BUNDLED_CLI, install_bundled_cli};

if HAS_BUNDLED_CLI {
    if let Some(path) = install_bundled_cli() {
        // lazily extracts on first call; idempotent thereafter
        println!("bundled CLI at {}", path.display());
    }
}
```

This returns the bundled CLI artifact, preserving the public API's original
meaning. Managed child-process transports resolve `copilot-runtime` instead.
The function returns `None` when `bundled-cli` is off or the target is
unsupported and does not fall back to the build-time extraction cache.

Use [`install_bundled_runtime`] when a health check or intermediate launcher
needs the managed runtime executable:

```rust,no_run
use github_copilot_sdk::install_bundled_runtime;

if let Some(path) = install_bundled_runtime() {
    println!("bundled runtime at {}", path.display());
}
```

This extracts `copilot-runtime` together with adjacent `runtime.node`, then
returns the wrapper path.

### Download cache (build-time, embed mode)

In embed mode `build.rs` downloads both verified archives on every clean build
by default. Set `BUNDLED_CLI_CACHE_DIR=<path>` to cache them between builds (CI
keys this on `<os>-<version>` for near-zero-cost rebuilds on cache hits). For
Copilot CLI 1.0.83-5, the two upstream archives total roughly 132-157 MB per
platform before the runtime package is filtered. With `runtime` enabled and
both `bundled-cli` and `local-runtime` disabled,
the extracted runtime bundle is the primary cache; a configured download
cache can also supply its initial extraction.

### Preparing release snapshots before publication

The two scripts in `scripts/` retain their no-option behavior: read
`../nodejs/package.json` and fetch the pinned CLI release's `SHA256SUMS.txt`.
Release packaging can instead supply local checksums and the final public
location, without waiting for that release to exist:

```bash
bash scripts/snapshot-bundled-cli-version.sh \
  --version "$RUNTIME_VERSION" --release-url "$RELEASE_URL" \
  --checksums "$LOCAL_SHA256SUMS"
bash scripts/snapshot-bundled-in-process-version.sh \
  --version "$RUNTIME_VERSION" --release-url "$RELEASE_URL" \
  --checksums "$LOCAL_SHA256SUMS"
```

`RELEASE_URL` is the exact base URL described above, without a trailing slash.
`LOCAL_SHA256SUMS` names the staged checksum file covering all eight executable
archives and all eight `github-copilot-<runtime-version>-<target>.tgz` payloads.
The existing `cli-version.txt` and `cli-version-in-process.txt` package entries
carry the version, hashes, and optional `release-url`; no separate manifest or
consumer configuration is required.

For normal promotions from an older compatible source, invoke the reviewed
producer scripts with `--output` pointing to each snapshot in the selected
Rust source staging directory. Pass the selected runtime version explicitly.
This preserves the older product's build code and does not require its source
to contain these producer scripts. Public unstable releases still require
selected-source support for the SDK-hosted acquisition location.

For offline build/package verification, seed `BUNDLED_CLI_CACHE_DIR` with the
host's executable and payload archives under these filenames:

* CLI release: `v<runtime-version>-<asset-filename>`
* SDK-hosted unstable release: `copilot-sdk-runtime-<runtime-version>-<asset-filename>`

Archive bytes must match the snapshot hashes; cache hits are verified and
corrupt entries are evicted. The executable is `copilot-<target>.tar.gz` (or
`.zip` on Windows); the payload is
`github-copilot-<runtime-version>-<target>.tgz`. A non-bundled build needs only
the payload archive and can also use this seeded cache for initial extraction.
Keep `COPILOT_SKIP_CLI_DOWNLOAD` unset during acquisition verification.

The focused acquisition checks use tiny local archive fixtures and never
download a runtime:

```bash
node --test scripts/snapshot-version.test.mjs
cargo test --no-default-features --features local-runtime --test build_acquisition
```

### Platforms

Supported: `darwin-arm64`, `darwin-x64`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`,
`linuxmusl-x64`, `linuxmusl-arm64`, `win32-x64`, and `win32-arm64`. The target
platform is auto-detected from `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_OS`, `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_ARCH`,
and `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_ENV` (cross-compilation works).

## Features

| Feature | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `runtime` | ✓ (via `bundled-cli`) | Enables managed runtime startup and discovery. With no runtime feature, use `Client::from_streams`; no runtime artifacts are acquired. |
| `bundled-cli` | ✓ | Enables `runtime` and embeds the managed wrapper pair and compatible CLI artifact. |
| `in-process` | — | Enables `Transport::InProcess` while preserving the selected runtime acquisition policy. |
| `local-runtime` | — | Enables `in-process` and, when `bundled-cli` is disabled, disables SDK-managed runtime download, extraction, and embedding. The application must supply a compatible runtime package through `COPILOT_CLI_PATH`. |
| `bundled-in-process` | — | Enables `in-process`, implies `bundled-cli`, and additionally embeds the platform-native runtime library. |
| `rustls` | ✓ | TLS for the `CopilotRequestHandler` HTTP/WebSocket forwarding transport via rustls (aws-lc-rs provider, OS trust store). No system OpenSSL required, so musl/static targets build. |
| `native-tls` | — | Platform-native TLS (OpenSSL on Linux, Secure Transport on macOS, SChannel on Windows) for the request-handler transport instead of rustls. With `default-features = false`, enable one of `rustls` / `native-tls` if you register a `request_handler` that forwards to HTTPS/WSS upstreams. |
| `derive` | — | `schema_for::<T>()` for generating JSON Schema from Rust types (adds `schemars`). |

```toml
# Default — bundles the Copilot CLI in your binary.
github-copilot-sdk = "1"

# Enable the in-process transport and bundle its native runtime library.
github-copilot-sdk = { version = "1", features = ["bundled-in-process"] }

# Enable the in-process transport with an application-supplied runtime.
github-copilot-sdk = { version = "1", default-features = false, features = ["local-runtime"] }

# Opt out of bundling, but retain managed startup and build-machine runtime caching.
github-copilot-sdk = { version = "1", default-features = false, features = ["runtime"] }

# External streams only — no managed startup or runtime acquisition.
github-copilot-sdk = { version = "1", default-features = false }

# Derive JSON Schema for tool parameters (adds to default bundled-cli).
github-copilot-sdk = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
```

## Development

Tests require a supported [Node.js version](../nodejs/README.md#prerequisites). From the repository root:

```bash
cd nodejs
npm ci
```

```bash
cd test/harness
npm ci
```

```bash
cd rust
cargo test --features test-support
```
